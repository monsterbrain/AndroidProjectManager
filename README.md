# AndroidProjectManager v1.0
## Desktop application to manage your android projects

**Here's it in Action**

<img src="img/apm_v1.0_screenshot.png" alt="drawing" width="640"/>

## Why I needed this ?
- Each time you have to go through project folder -> app -> build / main -> src -> com -> etc etc
- The Show in explorer function in Android Studio is Slow. For finding a project folder, opening it in
Android studio is an overkill I guess.
