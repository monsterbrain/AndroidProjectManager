## [Download Now (jar executable)](https://github.com/monsterbrain/AndroidProjectManager/releases/download/v1.0.0_release/APM_alpha_1.0.zip)
*Tested on windows OS. If any issues please file an [issue here](https://github.com/monsterbrain/AndroidProjectManager/issues)*

## How to use
- Run the program and **Drag & Drop** an Android project folder (containing build.gradle).
- The project with name (**same as Folder**) will be added to window.
- Clicking the buttons will open corresponding folder
- More features to be added later ...

## Why I needed this ?
- Each time you have to go through project folder -> app -> build / main -> src -> com -> etc etc
- The Show in explorer function in Android Studio is Slow. For finding a project folder, opening it in
Android studio is an overkill I guess.
